    "## 1.Introduction\n",
    "#### 1.1 Background\n",
    "Anime is  hand-drawn and computer animation originating from Japan. The word anime is the Japanese term for animation, which refers to all forms of animated media. Outside Japan, anime refers specifically to animation from Japan or as a Japanese-disseminated animation style often characterized by colorful graphics, vibrant characters and fantastical themes.Recommendation systems are a collection of algorithms used to recommend items to users based on information taken from the user. These systems have become ubiquitous can be commonly seen in online stores, movies databases and job finders. In this report, we will explore recommendation systems based on Collaborative Filtering and implement simple version of one using Python and the Pandas library. Collaborative filtering basis this similarity on things like history, preference, and choices that users make when buying, watching, or enjoying something. For example, movies that similar users have rated highly. Then it uses the ratings from these similar users to predict the possible ratings by the active user for a movie that she had not previously watched. For instance, if two users are similar or are neighbors in terms of their interested movies, we can recommend a movie to the active user that her neighbor has already seen.\n",
    "#### 1.2 Problem\n",
    "When a user want to watch a new series/ anime he /she would look fro different sources in order to choose a anime to their interest so  by using the dataset we have we can recommend anime which might be to their interest.\n",
    "#### 1.3 Interest\n",
    "As anime being one of the popluar interest among many users in the internet this recommendation engine helps the users to find their similar interest with respective to other users. "
